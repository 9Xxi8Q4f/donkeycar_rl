# Autonomous Driving W/ Deep Reinforcement Learning **(Ongoing Project)**

Autonomous driving task in a 3D simulation environment called "*DonkeyCar Sim*" using **Deep Reinforcement Learning** algortihms such as **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** and **Double Deep Q-Network with Prioritized Experience Replay (DDQN with PER)**.

**TASK:** Lane following and collision avoidance.

Autoencoder used for feature extraction of camera images and 2D lidar data.
Trial tests continue. Still under development

## Some evaluating result after 2 hour trainings
